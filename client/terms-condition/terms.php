                    copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws. You may not use, reproduce, distribute,
                    or
                    display
                    any content from the Site without our prior written permission.
                    <br>
                    5. User Content
                    You may have the opportunity to submit reviews, comments, or other content ("User Content") to the
                    Site. By
                    submitting User Content, you grant Yum Yum Rank a non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, and
                    worldwide
                    license
                    to use, reproduce, modify, and display such content on the Site and in connection with our services.

                    You are solely responsible for any User Content you submit, and you agree not to submit any content
                    that is
                    unlawful, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable. We reserve the right to remove or edit
                    User

                    at our discretion.
                    <br>
                    6. Health Scores and Product Information
                    Yum Yum Rank provides health scores for food products based on our research and evaluation of their
                    ingredients.
                    The health scores are intended to reflect the overall healthiness of the products based on general
                    nutritional
                    and ingredient information.

                    Important Notice: The health scores and product evaluations provided on our Site are based on our
                    analysis
                    and
                    may not account for individual health conditions or specific dietary needs. While we strive to
                    provide
                    accurate
                    and helpful information, our assessments may not be applicable to all individuals. For example, a
                    product
                    that
                    receives a high health score may still pose health risks for individuals with certain medical
                    conditions,
                    such
                    as diabetes, even if the product's ingredients are generally considered healthy.

                    We encourage users to consult with healthcare professionals or dietitians before making dietary
                    choices
                    based on
                    the information provided on our Site. Yum Yum Rank is not responsible for any adverse effects or
                    health
                    issues
                    that may arise from the consumption of products listed on our Site.
                    <br>
                    7. Product Descriptions and Availability
                    While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information about the products listed on our
                    Site, we do
                    not
                    warrant the accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any product descriptions, images, or other
                    content.
                    Product availability and pricing are subject to change without notice.
